# MAVLinkAnywhere

This is MavlinkAnywhere! This project provides comprehensive scripts to install and configure `mavlink-router` on a Raspberry Pi. `mavlink-router` is a powerful application that routes MAVLink packets between various endpoints, including UART, UDP, and TCP, making it ideal for UAV and drone communication systems.

## Installation Script

Our installation script seamlessly installs `mavlink-router` on your Raspberry Pi, taking care of all necessary dependencies and configurations.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alireza787b/mavlink-anywhere.git
   cd mavlink-anywhere
   ```

2. **Run the installation script:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x install_mavlink_router.sh
   sudo ./install_mavlink_router.sh
   ```

### What the Installation Script Does:

- Checks if `mavlink-router` is already installed.
- Removes any existing `mavlink-router` directory.
- Updates the system and installs required packages (`git`, `meson`, `ninja-build`, `pkg-config`, `gcc`, `g++`, `systemd`, `python3-venv`).
- Increases the swap space to ensure successful compilation on low-memory systems.
- Clones the `mavlink-router` repository and initializes its submodules.
- Creates and activates a Python virtual environment.
- Installs the Meson build system in the virtual environment.
- Builds and installs `mavlink-router` using Meson and Ninja.
- Resets the swap space to its original size after installation.

## Configuration Script

The configuration script generates and updates the `mavlink-router` configuration, sets up a systemd service, and enables routing with flexible endpoint settings.

### Usage

1. **Run the configuration script:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x configure_mavlink_router.sh
   sudo ./configure_mavlink_router.sh
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts to set up UART device, baud rate, and UDP endpoints:**
   - If an existing configuration is found, the script will use these values as defaults and show them to you.
   - **UART Device**: Default is `/dev/ttyS0`. This is the default serial port on the Raspberry Pi.
   - **Baud Rate**: Default is `57600`. This is the communication speed between the Raspberry Pi and connected devices.
   - **UDP Endpoints**: Default is `0.0.0.0:14550`. You can enter multiple endpoints separated by spaces (e.g., `100.110.200.3:14550 100.110.220.4:14550`).

### What the Configuration Script Does:

- Prompts the user to enable UART and disable the serial console using `raspi-config`.
- Reads existing configuration values if available, and uses them as defaults.
- Prompts for UART device, baud rate, and UDP endpoints.
- Creates an environment file with the provided values.
- Generates the `mavlink-router` configuration file.
- Creates an interactive script for future updates if needed.
- Stops any existing `mavlink-router` service.
- Creates a systemd service file to manage the `mavlink-router` service.
- Reloads systemd, enables, and starts the `mavlink-router` service.

### Monitoring and Logs

- **Check the status of the service:**
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl status mavlink-router
  ```
- **View detailed logs:**
  ```sh
  sudo journalctl -u mavlink-router -f
  ```

### Connecting with QGroundControl

Use QGroundControl to connect to the Raspberry Pi's IP address on the configured UDP endpoints. This allows you to monitor and control your UAVs efficiently.
